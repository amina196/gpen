We work with community organizations to plan and operate farmers' markets. We help CSA farms to prepare and post an on-line brochure, recruit CSA members, and do bookkeeping for them. During the off season, Farm to City runs the Winter Harvest Buying Club in which members select from over 300 items from local farms and small food businesses each month for weekly deliveries. 

Our web site helps farmers and food activists elsewhere use our web data base to create their own buying club ordering system and set up CSAs so that its members can order the items they want in their share each week. 

In 2010 Farm to City operated 10 farmers' markets, assisted four CSA farms by recruiting 400 members, delivered 18,000 food items through its Winter Harvest program, and launched its web services program.

Farm to City partners with Common Market, a distribution center in Philadelphia for locally grown produce, meat, poultry, dairy, and other farm products. "

"," The IRN was established by and for recyclers to address the numerous issues they face ? large numbers of materials recycled, distance to markets, multiple vendors to identify and manage, never-ending paperwork, limited processing and storage capabilities, limited budgets. Our mission to help out is twofold:

#1 - We make recycling simpler by providing a single point of contact to manage any and all recyclable materials. We identify and qualify end markets, we negotiate processing and marketing, we handle all aspects of load scheduling and logistics; and we provide accurate, timely accounting and reporting for all of the commodities we handle.

#2 - We improve the economics of recycling by pooling the collective strength of dozens of organizations. Even the largest college, hospital, or private firm is a small account in regional recycling and logistics markets. The IRN, in contrast, with over 125 member organizations, is a major account. As such we get the best prices in the marketplace, and favorable, reliable, and economical service from haulers, processors, and markets ? benefits that are passed along directly to IRN?s clients.
