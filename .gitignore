# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

.redcar
db/schema.rb

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/schema.rb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp/*
